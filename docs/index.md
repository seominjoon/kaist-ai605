There is no exam in this class.

## Course Description

This course covers recent advances in natural language processing area driven by deep learning. Topics include (but are not limited to)

- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Encoder-Decoder
- Transformer
- Language Model
- Pretrained Language Model (e.g. BERT)
- Text Classification (Sentiment Analysis)
- Sequence Tagging (NER, Question Answering)
- Sequence Generation (Summarization, Machine Translation, Semantic Parsing)
- Zero-shot Learning (e.g. GPT-3)
- NLP Tools (e.g. Hugging Face)

There are four assignments: 2 coding and 2 writing.

There will be two coding assignments that involve training deep learning models for text classification (sentiment analysis) and summarization (text generation), respectively. In the first assignment, you will be asked to use PyTorch library only. In the second assignment, you will use a popular NLP tool, Hugging Face, to complete the assignment. 

In this class, you will also learn how to write an NLP paper by analyzing the structure of recent papers published in NLP conferences (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL). The first writing assignment will be finding and analyzing frequent argument patterns, and the second writing assignment will be writing a sample research paper that adopts an interesting pattern you found (with dummy experiments).

The final project is creating an open-domain question answering system on EfficientQA dataset. The final deliverable will be a report. However, if you are working on an NLP-related research project, you are welcome to work on it instead (but please consult with me first).
